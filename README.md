<h1>Prisma Cloud DevOps Security</h1>

The Prisma Cloud devOps security capabilities are geared to meet the common goal of delivering releases faster and preventing security lapses by applying a consistent set of checks through the build-to-release process that keep your applications and infrastructure secure.

Prisma Cloud devOps security enables devOps and security teams to identify insecure configurations in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates and vulnerabilities in container images so that security issues are identified before actual resources are deployed in runtime environments.
To identify potential issues you can scan the content in your templates and files in AWS CloudFormation Templates (JSON or YAML format), HashiCorp Terraform templates (HCL format), and Kubernetes App manifests (JSON or YAML format) against a list of IaC policies policies. Currently, these policies provide good coverage of AWS and GCP CIS standards.
